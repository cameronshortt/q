* Quines

I was really bored, so I built a few quines in C and Perl.
Eventually this will expand to include more languages.

** C

`qp.c` isn't original, but I don't know where it
came from.  The rest are all variations on `qp.c`.

** Perl

`q.pl` also isn't original, but I arrived at roughly
the solution before I cheated during debugging.
